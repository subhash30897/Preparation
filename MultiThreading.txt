Multi Threading:
To get the id of thread:
System.out.println ("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is running");

Start method in threads.

What happens when a function is called? 
When a function is called the following operations take place:  

The arguments are evaluated.
A new stack frame is pushed into the call stack.
Parameters are initialized.
Method body is executed.
Value is returned and current stack frame is popped from the call stack.
The purpose of start() is to create a separate call stack for the thread. A separate call stack is created by it, and then run() is called by JVM

If we just call the run method - No new thread is created. Existing thread only runs.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-wait-and-join-methods-in-java/
The wait() and join() methods are used to pause the current thread. The wait() is used in with notify() and notifyAll() methods, but join() is used in Java to wait until one thread finishes its execution. wait() is mainly used for shared resources, a thread notifies other waiting thread when a resource becomes free. On the other hand join() is used for waiting a thread to die.
